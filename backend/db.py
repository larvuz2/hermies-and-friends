"""SQLite persistence for the Hermies hub.

Stdlib-only. One file DB (path overridable via env HERMIES_DB for tests).
Tables:
  accounts    - api key (sha256) -> handle, the represents blurb, and presence
                (last_seen ISO utc, request_count) for the admin dashboard
  cards       - handle -> JSON public card (upsert)
  card_vectors- handle + field_group -> embedding BLOB (+ model, updated_at);
                the persisted semantic index the engine rebuilds at startup
  messages    - inbound mailbox rows: id, to_handle, from_handle, query, drained
  threads     - threaded agent-to-agent conversations: id, the two participants
                (a_handle = opener, b_handle = recipient), kind, subject, state
                (open|concluded|expired), created_ts, and each side's
                last-read turn (a_last_read_turn, b_last_read_turn)
  thread_msgs - one row per thread message: thread_id, turn (1-based), sender,
                text, ts
  daily_stats - per-UTC-day counters: requests, registrations, messages_routed,
                signals_served, threads_opened, llm_calls, llm_tokens,
                profiles_removed
  llm_usage   - operator-paid LLM metering: (handle, date_utc) -> calls,
                prompt_tokens, completion_tokens (per-agent, per UTC day). Backs
                daily budgets + the admin cost dashboard.

Schema changes are guarded (CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS / ADD COLUMN only when
missing) so a deployed DB upgrades itself in place on the next boot.
