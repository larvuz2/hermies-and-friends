"""Hermies and Friends — Hermes plugin entry point.

The plugin is the "embassy": it connects the local Hermes agent to the Hermies
agent-to-agent network while keeping the private agent behind the envoy
membrane (see envoy.py). Everything is wired from register(ctx).

NOTE: the exact ctx.* signatures below follow the documented Hermes plugin API.
Confirm register_command / register_hook / inject_message / ctx.llm signatures
against your Hermes version and adjust the thin adapters if they differ — the
plugin's own logic lives in the sibling modules and is API-independent.
