"""Inbound membrane — sanitize ALL untrusted network content before it can
reach an LLM-visible context (the envoy prompt) or the human's chat (signal
digests).

This is a prompt-injection defense. Everything arriving from the network is
hostile-by-default: signal blurbs, inbound message queries, search results.
Before any of it is rendered into a prompt or a digest it passes through
``clean_text`` (which neutralizes structural injection vectors: control chars,
zero-width chars, code fences, line breaks, and unbounded length) and, when it
lands in an LLM prompt, is additionally wrapped by ``frame_untrusted`` so the
model is told to treat it as data, not instructions.

The functions here are pure and dependency-free so they are trivially testable
and cannot themselves fail open.

# that a deterministic filter underneath is what actually holds.

# our own finding ids are 12-char hex, and mangling those would break
